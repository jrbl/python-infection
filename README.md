- HARD:
 :) All the hard requirements have been met
- soft:
  - license summary headers in every file
  - write NOTICE and HISTORY files
  - comment headers indicating what the various files do
  - tests for Population behavior (?)
  - wrap set operations on Users to adding to one symmetrically adds to its target
  - tests for User once I've added the symmetric set management
